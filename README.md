# Brasileirão Analysis

## Description
This Python project involves web scraping data from the Brazilian Football League (Brasileirão) website using BeautifulSoup and requests. The script processes team statistics, such as points, matches played, victories, defeats, goals, and winning percentages. The data is analyzed with pandas, and the results are visualized through bar charts using matplotlib. The generated Excel file ('brasileirao.xlsx') includes detailed team statistics and two bar charts illustrating goal percentages and match-related information. The project offers a concise analysis of team performance in the Brazilian Football League.
